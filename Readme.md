## How to install

(tutorial totally not copy and pasted from Tunic AP mod and BTD6 Mod helper)

- Make sure to have [.Net6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed
- Download and Install [Melon Loader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation).
  - The default Slime Rancher install directory (for steam): C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Slime
    Rancher
  - Recommended melon version: 7.1
- Launch the game and close it. This will finalize the Melon installation.
- Download and extract the `Slimipelago.zip` from
  the [latest release page](https://github.com/SWCreeperKing/Slimipelago/releases).
  - Copy the `Mods` and `UserLibs` folders from the zip into the game's directory.
- Launch the game again and you should see no new or load game options!
- To uninstall the mod, either remove/delete the `Mods/SW_CreeperKing.Slimipelago` folder

> [!Note]
> This mod will most likely not work with the SRModLoader
> Double/triple/quadruple check the mod folder, melon might rename it to `~SW_CreeperKing.Slimipelago`
> which will prevent the mod from loading correctly
